# üéâ Cool GIFs For GitHub

A small collection of animated assets you can use in your GitHub profile READMEs, project READMEs, and issue/PR descriptions. Use the examples below to embed GIFs, MP4s, or link to a YouTube preview.

## üé¨ Animated Intro ‚Äî pick one option and replace the placeholder path

1) GIF (recommended ‚Äî simplest)
```md
![Animated demo](./gifs/animated-intro.gif)
```
Place your GIF file in this repository (for example at ./gifs/animated-intro.gif) and reference that path in your README.

2) MP4 (HTML5 video tag ‚Äî works in GitHub README)
```html
<video autoplay loop muted playsinline width="720">
  <source src="./gifs/animated-intro.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```
Upload an MP4 to ./gifs/animated-intro.mp4 (or use any absolute URL). GitHub will render the HTML5 <video> tag in READMEs.

3) YouTube preview (clickable thumbnail linking to the video)
```md
[![Watch the animation](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VIDEO_ID/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID)
```
Replace VIDEO_ID with your YouTube video ID. This shows a clickable thumbnail that opens the video on YouTube.

## ‚úÖ What I prepared
- A complete README file with three supported methods to include an animation in a GitHub README (GIF, MP4, and YouTube thumbnail).
- Clear instructions and example paths referencing the gifs/ directory inside this repository.

## What I need from you (so I can finish or further personalize)
- Which animation file in this repo would you like embedded? (e.g., gifs/animated-intro.gif or gifs/preview.gif)
- Do you prefer GIF, MP4 (autoplay/loop/muted), or a YouTube link?
- Would you like me to personalize the README with a short profile blurb (profession, top skills, social links)? If yes, provide those details.
- If you want me to push the change and open a PR for you, grant the repository write/PR permission in the GitHub UI (or let me know and I‚Äôll give you the exact patch to apply).

Tell me which file/path to use and any personalization details and I‚Äôll produce a final README ready to commit or a one-click patch you can paste into GitHub.
